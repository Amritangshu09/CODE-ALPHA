# Hangman Game

## Overview
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows players to guess letters to reveal a hidden word. If the player guesses the word correctly within a certain number of incorrect guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word from a list of words loaded from a file.
- Provides feedback on the guessed word and the letters used.
- Displays the number of guesses remaining.
- Allows players to play again after winning or losing.
- Graphical user interface with letter buttons for input.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Hangman game files.
4. Run the `hangman.py` file using the following command:
   ```
   python hangman.py
   ```
5. The Hangman game window should open, allowing you to play the game.

## How to Play
1. Once the game window opens, you will see a row of buttons labeled with letters of the alphabet.
2. Click on a letter button to guess that letter.
3. The game will display the word with any correctly guessed letters filled in, as well as the letters that have been used.
4. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.
5. If you guess the word correctly, you win the game. If you run out of guesses, you lose.
